Q1. Design a set of classes that incorporates following:

	1. Two entities Car and Bike

	2. A super class, Vehicle

	3. Distribute properties like Make, Model, Year, Price, sunroofAvailable, etc.

	4. Singleton service with single method that creates objects of both classes.
	   Service remains singleton in case of serialization and cloning

	5. Need to make sure no attribute of Vehicle is serialized ever.

	Test:

		1. Create 2 cars and 3 bikes and save them in-memory

		2. Check if a particular car model was created and is present in-memory

		3. Filter out all vehicles that were manufactured after year 2020 and print their details with price including GST of 18%.
